1000 MJ used per run of the Genepool


20000 MJ used not-identified drones per bucket of DNA
10000 MJ used 	  identified drones per bucket of DNA


10000 MJ produced per bucket of honey in engine


1 Honey drop = 64 identified drones (Beealyzer)

1 Bucket of Honey = 64x10 = 640 identified drones (Analyzer | automatic)

Total output should be at least 10000 MJ for the Liquid Honey used
+ 10000 MJ used to liquify the bees
+ Some gain to justify doing the whole proccess, otherwise we could store the honey and void the drones


If we burn 6.4 buckets of DNA we would use

64 drones
1 honey drops
64000 MJ from the Genepool
1000 MJ from the theoritical burn from honey

Then burning 1 bucket of DNA we use

10 drones
1/(64/10) honey drop
10000 MJ from the Genepool
1000/(64/10) MJ from the theoritical burn from honey

...

10000 + 156.25 = 10156.25 total MJ used for 1 bucket of DNA

Admiting a 10% gain, we end up with 11171.875 MJ that should be produced

For having a 4MJ/t production in the Biogas engine, we would want it to burn for 2792.96875 ticks

Rounding up, we have 2800 ticks for 4 MJ/t, for a total of 11200 MJ being produced (this only works with default energy consumption, Forestry in Easy Mode!)

If we can setup different levels of config (grabbing this from Forestry diff), then:

Easy: previous settings
Normal: We would actually consume 15156.25 MJ, so we should get 16671.875 MJ, rounding up, we have 16800 MJ produced for 4200 ticks
Hard: 40156.25 MJ consumption, we should get 44171.875, rounding up, we have 44200 MJ produced for 11050 ticks
